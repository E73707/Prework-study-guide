## Description
The project "Prework-study-guide" is my opening project and is my first        encounter with basic coding principals and languages. 
I was motivated to complete this project as I currently have a very basic understanding on coding/software development and having a resourse to return to will prove to be an invaluable asset in future learing endevours.
The project is a study guide including notes on Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is designed to be a guiding resourse for myself and possibly others looking to learn/store notes on the topics listed above. 
The project taught me the basic frameworks for the topics listed above through interactive learing.

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
